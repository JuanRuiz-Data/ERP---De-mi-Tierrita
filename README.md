# ERP - De mi Tierrita
<a href="https://demitierrita.com/" target="_blank">De mi tierrita</a>

This repository showcases the development of a **custom ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning)** system for the e-commerce brand **“De mi Tierrita”**, a case study built during the workshop **"Building an e-commerce from scratch"**, a hands-on program **created and taught by me**, where I guide participants through the entire process of designing, developing, and launching a real e-commerce product from zero.

While inspired by a real business, this project is also an **educational experiment** designed to combine:  
- **Software engineering**: Python, Django, MySQL, Docker, Kubernetes.  
- **Mathematical foundations**: Discrete Mathematics (Johnsonbaugh) and Calculus (Stewart).  
- **Project management best practices**: based on the *Google Project Management Professional Certificate*.  
- **Data engineering concepts**: data modeling, event-driven design, and process automation.

**Profiles envolved:**
- **(•_•) Software Engineering:** Focuses on designing and building the core ERP system using scalable and maintainable architectures. This profile covers backend development, service integration, infrastructure automation, and best practices.
- **(•‿•) UX / UI:** Ensures that complex ERP workflows remain intuitive and usable. This role translates business processes into clear user interfaces, designs user journeys, and improves the overall experience for both administrators and end users.
- **(¬_¬) Data Engineering:** Responsible for structuring, processing, and moving data across the system. This profile works on data modeling, event-driven flows, automation pipelines, and ensuring data consistency and reliability throughout the ERP.
- **(•̀_•́) Project Management:** Leads planning, coordination, and execution across technical and educational goals. This role applies industry best practices to manage scope, timelines, risks, and collaboration, ensuring the project evolves in a structured and sustainable way.
- **(⊙_⊙) Mathematics:** Provides the theoretical foundation behind system logic and decision-making. This profile applies concepts from discrete mathematics and calculus to model processes, optimize flows, and strengthen analytical thinking across the project.

## Project Goals  

- Build a **modular and scalable ERP** tailored for e-commerce operations.  
- Demonstrate how **logic and boolean algebra** can power the permission management based on the role (RBAC) and/or attributes (ABAC).
- Explore how **calculus and data analysis** can support smarter decision-making.  
- Provide a **real-world application** that bridges theory (math & PM) with practice (software engineering).  
- Showcase an **end-to-end product mindset**: from architecture and infrastructure to usability and business value.

## Core Modules  

- **Attribute base access control (ABAC)**: permission management.
- **Global Information**: central config for users, roles, permissions, departments, and points of sale.  
- **Supply Chain**: raw materials, production, inventory, and distribution.  
- **Human Resources**: recruitment, payroll, and performance management.  
- **Procurement**: purchase orders, supplier management, invoicing.  
- **Sales**: quotes, sales orders, and channel performance.  
- **Finance & Accounting**: income, expenses, taxes, and reporting.  
- **Shipping & Deliveries**: logistics optimization, tracking, and returns.  

---

## Tech Stack  

- **Backend**: Python + Django
- **Frontend**: React
- **Database**: MySQL  
- **Architecture**: Modular, event-driven design  
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Kubernetes  
- **Documentation & PM**: Notion, Excel
- **Design**: Figma
- **Problem solving analysis**: Draw.io

## Why this project matters  

This ERP is not just a management system — it’s a **sandbox for applied learning**.  
It demonstrates how a product can evolve from:  
1. **Concept** → defining business needs.  
2. **Architecture** → modular, scalable design.  
3. **Implementation** → coding with modern technologies.  
4. **Analysis** → applying math and logic to real-world decisions.  

It reflects a **full-stack problem-solving mindset**, valuable for tech companies and startups looking for product-oriented engineers or project managers who can bridge **business needs** and **technical execution**.
