# ERP - De mi Tierrita  

This repository contains the development of a **custom ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning)** system for the e-commerce brand **‚ÄúDe mi Tierrita‚Äù**, dedicated to selling gourmet sauces, healthy products, and bulk foods. This e-commerce project was created as a case study in the workshop **"Building an e-commerce from scratch"**, which you can also explore in the following repository: [link to project]  

The system is designed to meet the internal management needs of the business, with a modular, scalable approach, and built on principles of accessibility and inclusion.  

In addition, this repository is an **educational experiment** that combines:  
- Concepts from **Discrete Mathematics** (based on *Johnsonbaugh, 6th edition*).  
- Concepts from **Calculus** (based on *‚ÄúCalculus‚Äù by James Stewart*).  
- Concepts and implementation of **Project Management** (based on the *Google Project Management: Professional Certificate*).  
- Implementation using **Python** + **Django** + **MySQL**.  
- Concepts of **Data Engineering**.

Build a centralized management system that allows:  

- **Organizing users, roles, and permissions** in a clear and secure way.  
- **Controlling departments and points of sale**, distinguishing between owned and third-party.  
- **Optimizing operations** within each department through independent modules interconnected by events.  
- **Scaling easily** as the business grows and processes expand.  
- **Applying mathematical logic and inference** for decision-making (e.g., access control, data analysis).  
- Demonstrating how **propositional and predicate logic** can be used to **manage roles, permissions, and decisions** within an information system.  
- Demonstrating how **calculus** can be applied to data analysis and decision-making.
