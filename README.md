# ERP - De mi Tierrita  

This repository showcases the development of a **custom ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning)** system for the e-commerce brand **“De mi Tierrita”**, a case study built during the workshop **"Building an e-commerce from scratch"**.  

While inspired by a real business, this project is also an **educational experiment** designed to combine:  
- **Software engineering**: Python, Django, MySQL, Docker, Kubernetes.  
- **Mathematical foundations**: Discrete Mathematics (Johnsonbaugh) and Calculus (Stewart).  
- **Project management best practices**: based on the *Google Project Management Professional Certificate*.  
- **Data engineering concepts**: data modeling, event-driven design, and process automation.

## Project Goals  

- Build a **modular and scalable ERP** tailored for e-commerce operations.  
- Demonstrate how **logic and inference rules** can power role and permission management.  
- Explore how **calculus and data analysis** can support smarter decision-making.  
- Provide a **real-world application** that bridges theory (math & PM) with practice (software engineering).  
- Showcase an **end-to-end product mindset**: from architecture and infrastructure to usability and business value.

## Core Modules  

- **Global Information**: central config for users, roles, permissions, departments, and points of sale.  
- **Supply Chain**: raw materials, production, inventory, and distribution.  
- **Human Resources**: recruitment, payroll, and performance management.  
- **Procurement**: purchase orders, supplier management, invoicing.  
- **Sales**: quotes, sales orders, and channel performance.  
- **Finance & Accounting**: income, expenses, taxes, and reporting.  
- **Shipping & Deliveries**: logistics optimization, tracking, and returns.

## Tech Stack  

- **Backend**: Python + Django
- **Frontend**: React
- **Database**: MySQL  
- **Architecture**: Modular, event-driven design  
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Kubernetes  
- **Documentation & PM**: Notion, Excel
- **Design**: Figma
- **Problem solving analysis**: Draw.io

## Why this project matters  

This ERP is not just a management system — it’s a **sandbox for applied learning**.  
It demonstrates how a product can evolve from:  
1. **Concept** → defining business needs.  
2. **Architecture** → modular, scalable design.  
3. **Implementation** → coding with modern technologies.  
4. **Analysis** → applying math and logic to real-world decisions.  

It reflects a **full-stack problem-solving mindset**, valuable for tech companies and startups looking for product-oriented engineers or project managers who can bridge **business needs** and **technical execution**.
